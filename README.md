A cv generator which the user can input personal details into various inputs and have them combined into a neatly formatted CV.

update and going forward
I want to refactor the way the work input and display works

add a button that creates an additional form input for the work details
when that button is pressed, also create a new section on the CV
to house that.

not sure how this will work with states, but pretty sure it will be fine.
pretty sure it's literally made for this kind of thing.

update file structure with components and styles folders

break functions into different components.

update display styling for work experience.
update for modern styling.
