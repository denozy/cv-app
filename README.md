A cv generator which the user can input personal details into various inputs and have them combined into a neatly formatted CV.

update and going forward
I want to refactor the way the work input and display works

future updates
format cv display so that school and work experience are neater.
make form inputs collapsable
make the form inputs that appear on the cv toggelable to hide and unhide (add visible boolean to state)
add media queries
the page looks different on firefox vs chrome, figure out why
make cv display downloadable as pdf
